# NumberGussingGame
The Python project for beginners asks the user to enter a number, then lets him guess the number that the game guessed and gives him a hint to the number if it is above or below the number he guesses. Then informs him that he got the right number after several guesses.

We imported the random module first, then we created an if statement and a "While" loop in this project.
